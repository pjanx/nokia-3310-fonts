These are the fonts used on the Nokia 3310 phone.  I've reconstructed them by
hand, by looking at the screen and drawing the characters as I see them into
GIMP, and then done some processing to make this actually useful.

Use the .c files, as the textual representation doesn't have all the information
in it (some characters don't have a 1px space to the right of them).  I've added
it back in manually.

I've found this useful in VIM to highlight the zeros:
	:highlight mygroup ctermbg=red
	:match mygroup /0/

If you intend to render the fonts in your application, see nokia-fonts.c and the
related tools that use this file.

There are also some BDF files provided, so that you can e.g. create a TTF file
by converting them using fontforge and happily use the fonts wherever you like.
